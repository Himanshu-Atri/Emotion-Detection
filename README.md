# Emotion-Detection
Developed a multi-class emotion detection model using fine-tuned VGG16 with image augmentation for enhanced performance. The model identifies emotions from real-time video and draws bounding boxes around faces. A GUI program accompanies the model, providing an interactive interface for real-time emotion recognition.
